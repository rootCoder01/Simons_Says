# Simon Says ( C Languaje )

Description:
This project implements a version of the popular "Simon Says" game in the C language, incorporating a graphical user interface and sound effects. The game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds in the correct order.

The main objective of this project is to showcase the implementation of queues and stacks in C while also demonstrating proficiency in graphical and audio programming. It was developed as the final project for the Algorithms and Data Structures course.

Features:
Graphical user interface displaying colorful buttons representing different actions.
Sound effects corresponding to each action/button.
Random generation of sequences for players to repeat.
Ability for players to input their responses and compare them with the correct sequence.
Score tracking and level progression.
Planned improvements to enhance readability and project structure, despite already being delivered.

Project Status:
While this project has been delivered as the final project for the Algorithms and Data Structures course, there are plans for ongoing improvements. These improvements primarily focus on enhancing the readability and structure of the codebase to make it more maintainable and easier to understand for future developers.

Important Note:
This project was developed to demonstrate proficiency in algorithms, data structures, and graphical/audio programming in C. While efforts will be made to improve its readability and structure, please understand that it may currently have areas that could be optimized or better organized. Your patience and understanding are appreciated as we work to enhance this project further.
